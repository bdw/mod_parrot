mod_parrot
==========

The awesome module that will run your parrot programs from within apache!

What is there:

* running a parrot bytecode file
* redirecting standard output to apache

What is not there:

* everything else

Where everything else includes configuration, loading external scripts,
writing http headers, reading standard CGI values, tests, and more. But
still!
