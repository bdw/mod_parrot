Issues
======

A list of issues I'm currently thinking of working on

* Run NQP / perl6
* Run external scripts in a 'deeper' interpreter 
  (apparantly intepreter construction is not very slow at all)
* Keep persistent interpreters in a pool
* Disable CGI the loader in a threaded mpm 
* Make sleep() run normally (i.e., not crash)
